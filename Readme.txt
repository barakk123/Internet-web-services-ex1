# Emergency Supplies Inventory System

A simple Node.js application for managing emergency supplies inventory. This project provides functionality to create, read, update, and delete emergency supplies, making it an essential tool for crisis management applications.

## Goals and Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to offer a user-friendly system to manage emergency supplies during crisis situations. Users can perform operations such as adding new supplies, checking current inventory levels, updating supply details, and removing items that are no longer in stock.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- npm package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

	git clone https://github.com/barakk123/emergency-supplies-inventory.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

	cd emergency-supplies-inventory

3. Install dependencies:

	npm install

- Running the Application
Start the application with the following command:

	npm start

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000
You can also open the file "Index.html" for the UI.


#### Usage + Endpoints (API Documentation)

API documentation on Postman Cloud. [Use the link here to view API documentation]â†’(https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/32179347/2s9YypG48k).

- As a Software Engineer student at The Department of Software Engineering, Shenkar - This is the first exercise in the Web Services course.
- I have learned a lot from this exercise and I can't wait for the next one!
- As mentioned this is the first exercise, which means.. NOT everything is perfect! There are some problems...
	*The code structure could be optimized to reduce redundancy, especially in the functions related to handling supplies.
	*Inconsistent Data Validation
	*UI/UX Enhancements
